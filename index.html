<h2> About Me </h2>
<!-- Hakkımdaki genel bilgileri 2. başlığın altında yazıyorum. -->
<p> I'm Sena, 23. I'm an industrial enginner candidate. I currently live in Eskisehir, TURKEY. 
    I am a polyglot English tutor and I've been teaching English and Russian for about one year.
    The other languages I speak are German, Romanian and Turkish being my native.
    I love solo trips, visiting museums and listening to alternative music. I used to play the cello.</p>
<h2> About My Language Journey </h2>
<!-- Yabancı dillere ilgimi diğer bir başlık altında veriyorum, hayatımın önemli bir parçası olduğu için. -->
<p> I have always had interest in languages. I completed English prep class when I was 14. 2 years later, I've moved to Moldova,
    I started learning Russian and Romanian at the same time there. After getting my Moldovian Baccaleureate, started my Bachelor's 
    degree in Eskisehir. I plan to do my master's in Germany, so I've been learning German for about two years. </p>
<h2> About My Hobbies </h2>
<!-- Bu başlık altında hobilerimi biraz daha açıyorum. -->
<p> I see myself as a versatile person. My music taste may vary depending on my mood. I loved playing cello and piano, but I was 
    inconsistent on it. I love travelling. Travelling abroad is one of the main short-term plans of mine. </p>
